I'm gonna go out dancing, every night
I'm gonna see all the city lights
And do everything silver and gold
And I got to hurry up before I grow too old
I'm gonna take a trip around the world
I'm gonna kiss all the pretty girls
And do everything silver and gold
And I got to hurry up before I grow too old

Ooh, I do a lot of things I know is wrong
Hope I'm forgiven before I'm gone

I'm gonna kiss all the pretty girls
And do everything silver and gold
And I got to hurry up before I grow too old
