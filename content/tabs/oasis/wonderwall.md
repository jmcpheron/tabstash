[Intro]
Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4  (x2)

[Verse 1]
Em7              G
Today is gonna be the day
         Dsus4                 A7sus4
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em7              G
By now you should've somehow
    Dsus4                A7sus4
Realized what you gotta do
Em7                  G
I don't believe that anybody
Dsus4            A7sus4
Feels the way I do
      Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4
About you now

[Verse 2]
Em7              G
Backbeat the word is on the street
         Dsus4              A7sus4
That the fire in your heart is out
Em7                  G
I'm sure you've heard it all before
        Dsus4                A7sus4
But you never really had a doubt
Em7                  G
I don't believe that anybody
Dsus4            A7sus4
Feels the way I do
      Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4
About you now

[Pre-Chorus]
        C           D            Em7
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
        C           D              Em7
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
C              D
There are many things that I
        G      D/F#    Em7
Would like to say to you
              A7sus4
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
            Em7  G
Because maybe
                 Dsus4           A7sus4
You're gonna be the one that saves me
        Em7    G        Dsus4  A7sus4
And after all
                Em7   G
You're my wonderwall
Dsus4  A7sus4

[Verse 3]
Em7              G
Today was gonna be the day
        Dsus4                  A7sus4
But they'll never throw it back to you
Em7              G
By now you should've somehow
    Dsus4                A7sus4
Realized what you're not to do
Em7                  G
I don't believe that anybody
Dsus4            A7sus4
Feels the way I do
      Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4
About you now

[Pre-Chorus]
        C           D            Em7
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
        C           D              Em7
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
C              D
There are many things that I
        G      D/F#    Em7
Would like to say to you
              A7sus4
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
            Em7
I said maybe
G                   Dsus4           A7sus4
You're gonna be the one that saves me
        Em7    G        Dsus4  A7sus4
And after all
                Em7   G
You're my wonderwall
Dsus4  A7sus4

            Em7
I said maybe
G                   Dsus4           A7sus4
You're gonna be the one that saves me
        Em7    G
And after all
Dsus4           A7sus4
You're my wonderwall

[Outro]
            Em7
I said maybe
G                   Dsus4                   A7sus4
You're gonna be the one that saves me (x3)

Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4  (fade out)
