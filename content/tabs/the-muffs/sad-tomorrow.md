[Verse 1]
G / C D G D / G / C D G D
I don't even know why, do you think I'm a mess
Maybe someday but now you're gone
When I do as I please, I'm no different to me
Am I crazy or have good luck

[Pre-Chorus]
Em C Em C Em / A D D C
You're the talk of the town, so you say (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
G C G C / G F D / Em A Em C / Am D G
I don't know why you're so glad
When my head's filled with sorrow
So maybe if I fade away
There'll be no sad tomorrow

[Verse 2]
G / C D G D / G / C D G D
My whole life is a drag, baby listen to me
When I go away, will you care
I feel naked and weird, do you see what I hear
Maybe one day I'll die, who cares

[Pre-Chorus]
Em C Em C Em / A D D C
Hide away in complete misery (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
G C G C / G F D / Em A Em C / Am D G D
I don't know why you're so glad
When my head's filled with sorrow
So maybe if I fade away
There'll be no sad tomorrow

[Bridge]
G C D G D (x2)

[Pre-Chorus]
Em C Em C Em / A D
Hide away in complete misery

[Chorus]
G C G C / G F D / Em A Em C / Am D
I don't know why you're so glad
When my head's filled with sorrow
So maybe if I fade away
There'll be no sad tomorrow

[Outro]
Am D G E (x3, last time end on G)
There'll be no sad tomorrow
